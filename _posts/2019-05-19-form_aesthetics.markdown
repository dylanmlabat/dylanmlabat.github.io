When I first began my Sinatra project, I was able to fulfill all of the requirements with basic text input forms for my User and Deck classes. However, I was bothered by the lack of realism in keeping the decks that way. I personally know that the game has a limited number of formats in which each deck could be played and a limited number of colors that cards can be, so I wanted to limit users from being able to set those fields as whatever they wanted. I also disliked the way that decklists would paste and display as a single paragraph rather than a list of line items. In the end, I was able to research and implement unique form input types for each of these elements in order to create a more logical and aesthetically pleasing form for users:

The first input type I knew I wanted to implement was the checkbox input for colors since a previous lesson showed us how to iterate over a Pet class and give them to Owners upon creation. I first tried to follow that example and create a class variable set to an array of the colors I wanted. However, after a few attempts to run that code through the erbs I discovered a [resource](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_input_types.asp) with all of the HTML form input types and much easier method:

```
<p><label for="colors">Color(s): </label>
  <input type="checkbox" name="colors[]" value="Black">Black
  <input type="checkbox" name="colors[]" value="Blue">Blue
  <input type="checkbox" name="colors[]" value="Green">Green
  <input type="checkbox" name="colors[]" value="Red">Red
  <input type="checkbox" name="colors[]" value="White">White
  <input type="checkbox" name="colors[]" value="Colorless">Colorless
```

The above code instead inputs any number of the checked options into the colors param for a given deck, and allowed me to return those choices easily by performing `colors: params[:colors].join(", ")` when creating each deck. This fulfilled my desire for users to be able to pick any color combination they wanted when creating a deck, so long as they existed within the game as well.

I continued to browse w3schools after this, searching for a way to build a drop-down menu for my deck format choices. While I could have utilized checkboxes again, decks are typically not played within multiple formats even when the rules allow for it, so I wanted users to have to choose the main format for each deck instead. Eventually, I discovered an [article](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_form_elements.asp) that taught me about the select tag.

```
<select name="format" id="format">
    <option value="Standard">Standard</option>
    <option value="Modern">Modern</option>
    <option value="Legacy">Legacy</option>
    <option value="Vintage">Vintage</option>
    <option value="Commander">Commander</option>
</select>
```
	
This input type also has a range of options that would have allowed me to customize how the drop down list displays for users (number of options displayed, number that can be selected, etc.). However, since I only wanted users to choose one format for each deck, the default construction worked for me. I am, however, glad to know that it is customizable in and of itself should I ever find myself wanting to use that in the future.

The last thing I wanted to change was to add a larger input field for decklists. I was lucky enough to find the textarea input type explained right below select and was able to quickly implement it into my project, setting the exact column and row numbers I wanted to display the size text area I liked. It allowed me to paste in decklists with the line breaks I wanted and kept that when moving to the edit pages. However, when displaying deck pages, the field was again having the line breaks ignored and combining it into a paragraph instead.

I consider using Regex to split the text and then iterate over it to display it back but wasn't having any luck getting the display I wanted. I was also confused as to why it displayed correctly in the saved edit textarea field. After some time I was eventually able to discover the white-space CSS property. I was able to set a div class around my textarea in the display erb (`<div class="decklist"><br><%= @deck.decklist %></div>`) and then set the white-space to the preset value I wanted in my stylesheet:

```
div.decklist {
    white-space: pre-wrap;
  }
```

What began as a minor annoyance to me ended with me learning a number of useful HTML commands and drastically changing my project. That itself served as a great lesson for not settling on code that works if I have an idea for something greater. Researching my options helped me come out with something that still worked, but left me more satisfied with that work.
