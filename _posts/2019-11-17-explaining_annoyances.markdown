There are several reasons that I decided to study web development. I have always had a passion for it and have led a life steeped in technology starting from a young age. I had always considered moving away from computer science during my tenure at LSU as a mistake on my part. That's not to say that I dislike where I ended up, but my interest in programming as a concept has remained a constant in my life that I have pushed away from for some reason or another. Having finally decided to make an effort pursuing that interest, it is easy for my say that I love the work that I have done so far and am proud of my project efforts.

However, the unsuspected side effect is that even the limited knowledge that I have gained so far has made my current career situation more frustrating on a daily level. I'll spare the company from a specific namedrop but my technical frustrations have existed as long as I have worked there. This is also a sentiment that I have seen coworkers mirror for just as long. Despite loving my work environment on a social level, there were always complaints of slow network capabilities and necessary work application limitations. This was an issue that I had previously chalked up to budget constraints and hardware limitations.

As I have progressed through the bootcamp material, though, the flaws in my day-to-day applications have become more apparent. I can't speak to the languages or control flow at work, of course, but there are elements implemented that even I have become familiar enough with to question, seeing how they limit my productivity at a store level.

One of the most obvious examples is that I use an inventory system to input data and that data is reflected onto our consumer website. However, even though our inventory system contains data fields for the perpetual inventory stock levels of each item, this data is not included in the data that is reflected for consumers. This could be a purposeful design choice to limit consumer frustration caused by the fallibility of our store-level inventory maintenance, but it is just as frustrating for consumers to see orders be canceled or changed because they ordered something whose listing did not reflect our lack of stock.

I don't think I have the knowledge or experience to position myself as someone who could solve all of the issues I perceive in our internal systems. I do, however, appreciate that my education here has allowed me to move from being frustrated by certain aspects of the systems I deal with to understanding why those aspects may or may not exist and how they could be modified. Unfortunately, I have also found that this can either quell or expound on those frustrations. I am excited to take what I have learned and look to apply that in practical scenarios, rather than simply admonishing the systems I currently work within.
